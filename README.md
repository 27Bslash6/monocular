# Monocular

- Under ACTIVE development

Monocular is a search and discovery interface for Helm Charts Repositories. Charts Repositories are collections of curated Kubernetes application definitions.

A monocular is a single-lensed telescope, and perhaps a twee synonym for the kind of kit that would be useful when inspecting a disordered stack of nautical charts, like a magnifying glass or microscope with a spyglass aesthetic. Its adjectival form suggests a Cyclops, with whom Oddysseus was definitely on familiar terms; and its closest synonym is monocle, a well-worn accoutrement of Victorian Great Britain, surely the greatest of all naval empires. `kubernetes` indeed.

As with The Beatles, some things are better in mono.
